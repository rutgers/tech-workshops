## Module 0 - What are HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap?

* ** HTML ** stands for HyperText Markup Language - it's the syntax that defines the layout of all webpages. It includes a webpage's text and images.

* ** CSS ** stands for Cascading Style Sheets - it's what defines the color and size of information on the webpage.

* ** Javascript ** is a programming language used in webpages that is run in your browser.

Most popular sites use all three of these languages to create responsive webpages.

* ** Bootstrap ** is a CSS Framework used to create beautiful responsive pages quickly. It's easy to use, compatible with all modern browsers, and it's mobile first.

Building a bootstrap website normally starts with a template and modifying the HTML source to match what you want

## Module 1 - HTML

HTML is built around tags - all text on a page starts and ends in a tag. For example:

```html
<body> This is a body tag </body>
```

## Module 2 - A Basic Template

First, download the template named carousel.html that can be found in this folder. Then, try opening the file with your browser of choice. This template features a carousel that automatically switches between multiple photos in addition to a responsive navbar. Try playing around with changing the `src` attribute of the various `img` tags to see how it changes the site.


## Module 3 - The Grid System

In order to actually add a new section, we're going to have to either create a new page or add a `<div>` tag at the bottom of the page above the footer section. Let's try adding a new div tag with the class attribute set to container:

```html
<div class="container">
 <div class="row">
 </div>
</div>
```
