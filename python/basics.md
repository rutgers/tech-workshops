Ravi Bhankharia, Niral Shah

## Module 0 - What is Python?
   * Python is a high level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented scripting language. 
      * _Python is interpreted_: This means Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. 
      Languages similar to this: PERL, PHP. Also its dynamically typed, which means
      * _Python is Object Oriented_: Python is designed to support Object-Oriented style programming, like Java.
      *_Python is Beginner Friendly!_: Python is an extremely versatile and widely used language. It's syntax is very beginner
                                      friendly and will make it easier to pick various other languages like Java, C++, etc. 
## Module 1 - Basic Syntax

### A. Input/Output
   *  Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter brings up the following prompt âˆ’
  
    ``` 
       $ python
      Python 2.4.3 (#1, Nov 11 2010, 13:34:43)
      [GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)] on linux2
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      >>>
    ```
  *Script Mode:
  * Executing a Script: 
    *   Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python files have extension .py. Type the following source code in a test.py file: 
  ``` 
   print "Hello, Python!"
   ```
   
Cover how to run a python program, how to print Hello World, how to use raw_input/prompt/input(), how to make a variable

### B. Loops and Conditionals

Cover if statements, while loops, for loops
break statements. 
identations.
### C. Lists/Arrays and Dicts

Show how to make a list and a dict (and what they are)

### D. Functions

Show how to make a function using def

## Module 2 - Guessing Game

Have them make a guessing game. (Bonus Points for figuring out and using the random.randInt function) i'll post a functioning guess program after.)
